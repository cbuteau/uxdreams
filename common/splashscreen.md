## When to use

Use a splash screen when your native or web application has a long initialization process.

## How to use

Keep it simple try to go for just an image or simple svg graphics to display.

Only dismiss once clicked on or when initialization is complete.

If you dismiss earlier then you leave users hanging in confusion.
