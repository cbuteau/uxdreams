# uxdreams
A repository on the future of UX in web and native design.

## Concept

The idea is to have multiple markdown files that discuss proper design to appeal to users.

The initial split should be web from native.
But beyond that certain concepts can be shared.


## Layout

+ [Web]('./layout/web.md')
